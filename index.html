      <p class="title">What's new ?</p>
      <p class="paragraph">First of all, this Website! It was recently created, and is still a work in progress, but it allows us to have display
        on all of our projects, including the Logic Kits (and more coming later), in the way we like, with the formating we choose. Of course, it is also some sort of challenge,
        as most of us haven't really ever made a website before.
